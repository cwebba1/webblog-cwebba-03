        <p>Silver Fox Renewables LLC designs, installs and maintains high quality solar-powered energy generation systems.</p>
        <p>Customers range from residential customers, electric carport servicing stations, to businesses, industries and municipalities.</p>
        <p>Craig Webb worked with Silver Fox Renewables LLC to write clear content to describe their products and services, and to populate the website.</p>

        <h3 style="column-span: all;">Website Content</h3>
        <p>There usually isn&rsquo;t much point in having a website without written content.</p>
        
        <p>Clients often ask me to write content for their website along with designing graphics and creating the website.</p>
        
        <p>Website content is what attracts customers who are searching on the Internet and provides the information consumers need once they get there. Well-written content sells the service or product to the consumer.</p>
        
        <p>Content creation happens by a combination of conducting marketing research and working with the client to interview and garner their message.</p>
        
        <p>Most business executives can describe their business but many successful men cannot write.</p>
        
        <p>Writing website content is a specialized skill. Information must be concise and organized to be read. Content must be relevant.</p>
        
        <p>Equally important is to write with phrasing that people use to search for products when browsing the Internet.</p>
        
        <p>Research is necessary to discover the searchable phrases that consumers use to search for goods and services.</p>
        
        <p>The specialized language of business may include adopting aficionado&rsquo;s lingo, using business jargon and paying attention to marketing paradigms.</p>
        
        <p>Consumers want clear sentences that get to the point quickly.</p>
        
        <p>Once a body of content is developed, it is edited to cut the verbiage. Content is valuable and can be repurposed to flow into all sorts of media.</p>

        <p>Recently I applied to volunteer and join the Production team. My tribe-mate applied for the Packing-Day team.</p>
        
        <p>Previously our tiny tribe, which is dispersed across states, discussed the possibility of us all coming together for packing day so we could meet face-to-face. I fielded the idea of coming to visit the Packing Day Team and bringing up some snack or something.</p>

        <p>A tragic event happened this summer in Seattle during the Black Lives Matter protests that I keep thinking about; what I came to see, and what I learned about myself and my relationship with racism.</p>
        
        <p>The Black Femme March against racism and police violence, a festive, peaceful protest for BLM was followed by a drive-by hit and run that killed one person and badly injured another.</p>
        
        <p>The person who was killed was a 24-year-old named Summer Taylor. The injured person was Diaz Love, a 32-year-old from Portland, Oregon.</p>
        
        <p>I saw Summer Taylor&rsquo;s photo on Twitter after the event and at first I only knew them as &ldquo;The girl with the pink hair&rdquo;.</p>
        
        <p>I have since learned that Summer Taylor used non-binary they/them pronouns. 24-year-old Summer Taylor with the pink hair worked at the Urban Animal veterinarian clinic by day and was an activist by night, participating regularly in the Black Lives Protests, which had continued daily for months, and still continue to this day.</p>
        
        <p>Reading about the protest and Summer Taylor’s death the following morning on Twitter, I came upon a video of people participating in the protest before the car incident.</p>

        <p>This year of pandemic I have made three journeys into Manhattan to buy art supplies. Most stores were closed in the first few months but in July the art supply stores began to open. I called ahead and mapped out a journey from SoHo to Herald Square.</p>
        <p>I have used my pandemic quarantine time to paint and draw. The media I work with are sumi ink, pencil drawing and egg tempera. Each has their place in my expression. Egg tempera is special for the chemistry of it and the vibrancy of color.</p>
